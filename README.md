# Value of Information as a Measure in Model-Based Exploration

This repository serves as the platform for my master's thesis project, organized into two distinct sections. The initial section centers around the course code 'Research Module in Applied Geophysics 23ws-54.12000'. This research module serves as a precursor to the final master thesis and primarily focuses on a Monte Carlo ensemble simulation of a simplified ("2.5D") geothermal reservoir model using the geological modeling software GemPy. Different sedimentary graben systems will be analyzed.

The aim of this project is to identify the extent of the uncertainty factor in a geothermal plant concerning the increase in available information, in this case, the drilling of an exploration cost. This visualization of uncertainty is referred to as information entropy. The visualization will be conducted using the main equation defined by Hall et al. in 2020 and will be programmed into a Python workflow.

# Research Module Objectives:

1. Familiarization with GemPy
2. Create a Monte Carlo model ensemble comprising 200 to 300 model realizations
3. Literature survey and review of:
   a. Methods behind GemPy (implicit co-kriging, see de la Varga et al. (2019))
   b. Decision Trees and Value of Information in Exploration
   c. (optional) LCOH of operating geothermal systems worldwide
4. Implementation of a sequential VoI assessment workflow as described in Hall et al. (2022) in Python.
5. VoI analysis of different exploration borehole locations
6. Familiarization with Geophires

# Research Module Timeline:

Deadline: Friday, 26th of January 2024, 17:00.

# Master Thesis Objectives:

The outcomes and tasks of the thesis will be detailed after the 26th of January 2024.

# Master Thesis Deadline:

The project is scheduled for completion by August 2, 2024.

# Collaborators and Supervision:

The entire thesis project is a collaborative effort with the Fraunhofer Institute, supervised by Jan Niederau and Prof. Florian Wellman. The final results will be presented on August 21, 2024, at RWTH Aachen.
